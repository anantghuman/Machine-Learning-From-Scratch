# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch using NumPy and pandas. Each algorithm is designed to work with Kaggle datasets, showcasing fundamental principles and techniques in machine learning.

## Algorithms Implemented

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks, aiming to find the optimal hyperplane.
  
- **Decision Tree**: A tree-based model for classification and regression that splits data into subsets based on feature values.

- **Perceptron**: A simple binary classifier that updates weights based on misclassified instances.

- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised learning algorithm for partitioning data into K distinct clusters based on feature similarity.

- **Linear Regression**: A regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a linear equation.

- **Polynomial Regression**: An extension of linear regression that models relationships as an nth degree polynomial.

- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees and merges them to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

- **Neural Networks**: A basic implementation of feedforward neural networks, demonstrating the principles of deep learning.
